//Nth term of Fibonacci series F(n), where F(n) is a function, is calculated using the following formula -

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


int main(){
    //Write your code here.  
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int a = 1, b = 1, c;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        a = b;
        b = c;
        c = a + b;
    }
    cout << c;
}
